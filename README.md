| ðŸš— [PRKR App](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RgJp-cxrVsqAsje2zU_8VXxksKuIg3JO/edit#slide=id.p18) | For this project, my team and I brainstormed startup ideas and developed a digital app solution that reduces the amount of time it takes to find, reserve and rent out privately-owned parking spaces. We crafted a comprehensive digital marketing plan to promote the app, outlining strategies for online advertising, social media engagement & user acquisition, and I facilitated communication between cross-functional teams, tracked and coordinated project tasks & deliverables to ensure that they were completed on time.
